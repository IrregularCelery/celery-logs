# CeleryLogs ðŸŒ±

Welcome to **CeleryLogs ðŸŒ±**, a daily activity log where I document my progress on programming, projects, and anything else Iâ€™m working on. It's my way of keeping track of all the things I accomplish each day!

## Why "CeleryLogs ðŸŒ±"?

Inspired by my nickname, **Irregular Celery**, this repo reflects my approach to projects and my love for celebrating every achievement.

## Purpose

This log is not just about codingâ€”itâ€™s about celebrating every step of an enjoyable journey, from tweaking configurations to editing videos. **Every small effort adds up to something meaningful.**

## Format

Each dayâ€™s log is simple and clean:

```markdown
## Jan. 02, 2025

- **22:41**: Worked on a `Secret Project`
- Tweaked my dot files
- Started researching for a new project!

## Jan. 01, 2025

- **12:34**: Edited `Intro` part of the `PadPad` video
- **02:45**: Created `Thumbnail`
```

## Features

1. Grouped by date for clarity.
2. Timestamps are optional and used only when needed.
3. You can log a variety of activities, not just programming.
