- More ideas for the Minecraft mod:
  - "Ascended Hoe": While harvesting crops, it automatically re-plants the crop from the inventory.

## April 30, 2025 (Wed)

- Some ideas for the Minecraft mod:
  - "Ascended Pickaxe": Tool Mastery -> After mining certain amount of blocks, the item upgrades
    itself and enables a custom ability or something.
  - "Ascended Sword": Have a chance of applying effects to mobs (e.g. poisoned, slowness,
    weakness, etc.)

## April 29, 2025 (Tue)

- Brainstormed some ideas for a late-game feature: There's a custom structure about 50,000 blocks
  away from the spawn. The structure only spawns about 100 blocks above the ground and the area is
  unbreakable and unbuildable, so the player will need elytra to access the structure.
  Inside the structure, there will _probably_ be some custom blocks.
  One is called "Runebinding Altar" which serves the most important purpose of the structure.
  it takes any armor piece or tool, as well as a custom item called "Rune of Ascension", and
  in return it will max out the enchantments of the said armor/tool. (You used to be able to have
  multiple protection enchantments simultaniously on an armor piece, this is no longer possible.
  but the "Altar" would add all the protection enchantments for the armor pieces. as for the tools
  there'll be some extra additions, to make the "Altar" more worth)
  Whether the armor/tool needs to already have certain enchantments isn't decided yet : D
  About the "Rune of Ascension" item: you'll need to craft a base item called "Runestone" first.
  Then, _probably in the custom structure_, there'll be another custom block _no names yet :D_
  that the player can use to "create" the "Rune of Ascension". For that, the player must have
  at least 100 levels of XP, a Nether Star, Dragon's Egg, a Totem of Undying (player will die
  in the process of the ritual). This process will only be doable when the moon is full : D
  Oh, and the "Rune of Ascension" will only have 10 uses total (for all armor pieces and all tools).
